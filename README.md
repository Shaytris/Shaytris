# How to Build

**Building the client is easy and can be done on almost any platform**



<details><summary>Windows</summary>
Prerequisites

A **IDE** is very helpful to edit the code and modify the client from sourse, we recommend using VSCode as we use it to write the game. you can download vs code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) from their website, however even using notepad works since you can still edit code using it.

**Git** is required to build the client you can do so very easily on Windows, MacOS and Linux here's how for your platform.




It's easy to install Git on Windows simply download the installer from Git's website [Download Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Then open Git Bash simply from your start menu then type the command below in your command line.
